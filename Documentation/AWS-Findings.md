# AWS Findings

## Nov 28 :
1) There is a [document](https://gifttutoring.org/projects/gift/wiki/Deploying_to_AWS) that guides us to deploy GIFT to an AWS instance.
2) Note, before proceeding with this route, they ask us to :
> Obtain authorization from ARL(Army Research Laboratory, most probably) to have new AWS server instances spun up for the specific research project or GIFT development branch.
3) I just skimmed thorugh the entire document. At various places it asks us to use the files in GIFT/branches directory. But even in the latest 2023 release there is no such folder.
4) I then came across this line:
> The current GIFT process for deploying to AWS is not yet committed to the GIFT release.
