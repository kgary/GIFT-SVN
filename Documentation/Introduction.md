# Overview  

## What?
GIFT is a “educational evaluation” tool. It connects with external training applications like VBS, or PowerPoint and evaluates a user’s performance over it.
## Why?
Do you have a training application (e.g.VBS, TC3/Vmedic, UrbanSim, a flight simulator, a physics tutor, etc. – in other words, an environment where a user will be assessed on performance when conducting one or more tasks) ?
That’s why you need GIFT. You’d basically integrate that training application with GIFT.
## How?
100s of files in folders. Java apps. BAT Scrips. ANT Scripts. XML/XSD files. Seemingly following Wedding cake fitted with Toaster design pattern ~ Dr. Gary
The Developer URL is a treasure chest. It basically has everything we’d need to get this up and running.
## What is my role here:
•	Figure out & map the entire architecture of the GIFT application
•	Discover places(APIs or whatever) provided to connect GIFT to external ASU project applications(e.g. Dreamscape): Gateway Module Interop Connection
•	Add everything(literally) on Github. No need to be neat, the repo can be as messy as possible.
•	Be exhaustive in your research before meetup with GIFT-team or Dreamscape team
## Modules:
1.	Sensor Module
2.	Domain Module
3.	Pedagogical Module
4.	Learner/Trainee Module
5.  Tutor User Interface (TUI)
