# Messaging Systems 

## Tutor Module Messaging System

The tutor modules use a complex messaging system within a software framework, designed for tutoring modules that interact with a server and potentially other modules or services. This system appears to employ a variety of message types and leverages an underlying messaging architecture that facilitates communication between different components of the system. 
The system uses an enumerated type MessageTypeEnum to define various message types that dictate the kind of action or response expected upon receipt. 
These messages encapsulate requests, commands, and notifications related to the management of tutoring sessions, user interactions, and content delivery within the tutoring system.

## Tutor Module Messaging Architecture
The underlying architecture applies a publish-subscribe (pub/sub) messaging pattern facilitated through a message queue or topic-based system. This is evidenced by:

- **SubjectUtil.TUTOR_QUEUE**: References to specific queues or topics that messages are published to or subscribed from, indicating a segmented messaging system where different queues or topics are dedicated to specific types of messages or modules.
- **Message Handling**: The handleMessage method demonstrates a dispatcher pattern, where incoming messages are inspected, and based on their type, different handlers are invoked to process the message.
- **Asynchronous Callbacks**: The use of callbacks (AsyncResponseCallback, MessageCollectionCallback) suggests that the system is designed for asynchronous communication, where responses to requests might not be immediate, but are handled through callback mechanisms once the response is available.
- **Domain Sessions**: The concept of domain sessions, managed through messages, suggests a stateful interaction pattern within the tutoring sessions. State changes are communicated through specific message types like START_DOMAIN_SESSION, CLOSE_DOMAIN_SESSION_REQUEST, etc.

The messaging architecture seems to be built on a combination of message queueing, pub/sub patterns, and asynchronous processing. This architecture supports modularity, scalability, and decoupled interactions between different components of the system. The exact implementation details of the message queue or pub/sub system (e.g., MQTT, AMQP, Kafka) are not specified in the provided code.

## Tutor Module with Unity Embedded Training Application Messaging

- **GiftConnection GameObject**: An invisible GameObject in Unity that facilitates receiving messages from GIFT. It represents the communication link between the Unity application and GIFT.

- **GIFT Unity SDK**: A set of prebuilt C# classes, Unity scripts, and Unity prefabs that simplify the process of adding GIFT functionality to a Unity application. The SDK handles the serialization and deserialization of messages, making it easier to send and receive messages.

- **Message Handling**: The Unity application uses handlers to process incoming messages from GIFT (e.g., SIMAN and Feedback messages) and to send appropriate responses or state updates back to GIFT.

- **Window.postMessage JavaScript API**: Used to send messages to the embedded Unity application from the Tutor client running in a web browser. This allows for communication between the GIFT Tutor Module (server-side) and the Unity application (client-side).

- **Unityâ€™s API**: Within the Unity application, messages received from the Tutor client via JavaScript are passed into the Unity engine using Unity's API, where they are processed by the GIFT Unity SDK and corresponding event handlers.

- **Pub/Sub Messaging Pattern**: The architecture suggests a publish-subscribe pattern where GIFT publishes messages (commands, requests, feedback) that are subscribed to and handled by the Unity application. Conversely, the Unity application can publish state updates or responses that GIFT subscribes to and processes accordingly.

The format of the messages exchanged between Unity applications and GIFT, particularly as described in the context of using the GIFT Unity SDK, is JSON.

A typical message exchanged between a Unity application and GIFT consists of two main components: type and payload.

- **type**: A string that specifies the type of the message. This helps the receiving side (either GIFT or the Unity application) to understand how to process the message. For example, the type might indicate whether the message is a SIMAN command (for controlling the lifecycle of the application), a feedback message, or a state update from the Unity application.

- **payload**: Contains the actual data of the message. The structure of the payload can vary depending on the type of message. It is a JSON object that can include various fields and nested objects.

Sending and receiving messages:
- **From Unity to GIFT**: When the Unity application needs to send a message to GIFT, it constructs a JSON message with the appropriate type and payload, serializes it, and sends it through the established communication channel. For example, to indicate that a button was pressed within the Unity application, it might send a message with a custom state update.

- **From GIFT to Unity**: GIFT sends JSON messages to the Unity application to control its behavior or to deliver instructional content. The Unity application listens for incoming messages, deserializes them from JSON, and then processes them according to their type and payload.


Example message:
  ```json
{
  "type": "SIMAN",
  "payload": {
    "Siman_Type": "Start",
    "RouteType": "Embedded",
    "FileSize": 0
  }
}
```
