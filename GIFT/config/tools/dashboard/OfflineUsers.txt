# OfflineUsers.txt
#
# The offline users file contains a list of preset usernames that can be used in desktop mode when offline. These users
# will automatically be populated into the UMS database and other needed initialization. 
#
# Usernames must adhere to the following rules:
#   - All lowercase
#   - Do not contain spaces
#   - Follow normal GIFT portal username requirements (no special symbols, etc).
#   - must be at least 3 characters long (not including leading or trailing whitespace)
#
# To use this file, comments can be added with the "#" symbol at the beginning of the line.  Users should be added
# after the comments sequentially with one username per line.  An example could look like the following:
#    testuser_1
#    testuser_2
#    testuser_3
#    ..etc...
#
# Collisions with existing names are ignored.  
# Leave the list of names empty if this feature is not needed.
# 
# This is used by mil.arl.gift.tools.dashboard.server.OfflineUsers.java
