#
# This file defines a set of predefined user credientials that can be used to sign in to GIFT without using an external 
# authentication system, such as the default authentication logic used by GIFTPortalUserAuthentication.java.
#
# Any account credentials defined below will used by mil.arl.gift.common.gwt.server.authentication.LocalAccountAuthentication.java 
# 
# Account creditials are defined using lines of username and password pairs, like so:
# username1=password1
# username2=password2
# johndoe=12345678
#
# (Note that some characters, like # and =, have special meaning and generally shouldn't be used by passwords in this file)
#
# If at least one username-password pair is defined below, then LocalAccountAuthentication.java will be used instead of an
# external authentication system. Note that this will mean that only users with the credentials defined below will be able
# to sign into this GIFT instance, even if they would normally be able to sign in to the default authentication system.
#
# Local account authentication does not bypass the user white list defined in WhiteListUsers.txt, so if any usernames have been
# specifically whitelisted in that file, then only those usernames will be able to sign in.
