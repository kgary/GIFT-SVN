<!--
	Uncomment the configurations below to have GIFT use Keycloak authentication to protect its webpages 
	using Keycloak's user role management.
	
	If Keycloak is enabled, it will supercede GIFT's default authentication to the GIFT Portal and any local
	accounts that have been specified, basically making it the primary authenticator.
	
	Additionally, enabling Keycloak will bypass GIFT's normal login page and use the login page provided by the 
	Keycloak server in its place. 
	
	This configuration does nothing on its own but is inherited by the Jetty web application XML files that are 
	used to configure all of GIFT's servers. This allows the Keycloak settings to be specified in one file rather
	than repeated for each server.
	
	The settings bellow add a new security handler to GIFT's web applications to use the KeycloakJettyAuthenticator.
	Within this authenticator, GIFT specifies the realm, client, and authentication URL that's needed to perform
	a request to the appropriate authenticator within Keycloak. It also disables SSL to allow Keycloak to be used with
	localhost over an HTTP connection and uses the preferred username of a user to identify them.
