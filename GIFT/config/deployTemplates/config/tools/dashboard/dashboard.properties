# A landing page message that is displayed on the dashboard login webpage.
# This can be used to notify the user of scheduled maintenance in where 
# the dashboard instance will not be available or will be changing
# at some point in time in the future.   
#
# Note:
# 1) if the dashboard is running and you had a value for the property but since commented out, the previous
#    value will still be used.  In order to clear the previous value simply set it equal to nothing.
# 2) changes to the value will be reflected the next time the user visits/refreshes the login webpage
# 3) The message is displayed in the top of the login panel.  Before publishing live you should test out
#    how the message looks on a local machine.

# Variable to control if the cloud version of the login page should be displayed.  The cloud version of the 
# login page is different than the normal GIFT login page in that it forces the user to accept the terms of
# the GIFT EULA, and also has different branding and messaging to describe the cloud version of GIFT.
# This value should only be set to true for the cloud version of GIFT.  Most users should never need to change
# the value of this setting.
# The default is false (which means to use the normal login page).

# Whether a course should be validated using GIFT logic when the course is:
# 1. started via the GIFT dashboard's 'My Courses' webpage.
# 2. selected as a course to be published
#
# Setting to 'false' will still leverage checking last successful validation date against course folder last modification date to
# determine if GIFT validation should take place on a per course basis. 
#
# Setting this value to 'false' can enable a faster loading of the course by removing the logic that checks the course
# and its references (e.g. DKF) against GIFT validation logic (i.e. is the referenced website/file/etc reachable).   
# The course and its references (e.g. DKF) will still be validated against the GIFT XML schemas.

# Whether survey elements referenced in a course should be validated when the course is: 
# 1. started via the GIFT dashboard's 'My Courses' webpage.
# 2. selected as a course to be published
#
# Setting this value to 'false' will enable a faster loading of the course by removing the logic that checks the course's
# references survey elements against the connected survey system.

# Default if not specified: false
