<p><strong>Checkpoint Pace Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition checks the pace of the learner's player/character/entity in 
the external application through one or more, ordered, checkpoints.&nbsp; The 
condition requires one or more checkpoints to be provided, each defined by a 
location (e.g. GDC) with a time constraint.&nbsp; Each time constraint can also 
have a window of opportunity associated with it to act as a grace period for the 
learner to reach that checkpoint and not be negatively assessed.</p>
<p>This is different than Checkpoint Progress condition because in this 
condition the learner must reach the checkpoint in order for the learner to be 
assessed, where as in Checkpoint progress condition the learner does not. </p>
<p><strong>Assessment Evaluations </strong>(Real-time)</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #008000">Above Expectation</span></li><li>
	<span style="color : #0000FF">At Expectation</span><ul>
		<li>case: the default assessment level</li>
		<li>case: reached a checkpoint ahead of or equal to the specified pace 
		defined by the checkpoint's time attribute</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span style="color : #FF0000">Below Expectation</span><ul>
		<li>case: reached a checkpoint late or behind the specified pace defined 
		by the checkpoint's time attribute</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Unknown</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Possible </em>Scored Evaluations </strong>(overall)</p>
<ul>
	<li>counts the number of checkpoints that were not reached on time</li>
	<li>provides the amount of time the learner was in violation of being behind 
	pace, i.e. the total amount of time this condition was at Below Expectation. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous details</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>completes after the last checkpoint location has been reached and 
	assessed</li>
	<li>can not be repeated, i.e. once you reach the last checkpoint you can't 
	start this same condition instance from the first checkpoint</li>
</ul>
