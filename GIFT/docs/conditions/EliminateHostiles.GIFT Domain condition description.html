<p><strong>Eliminate Hostiles Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition checks whether a list of pre-defined entities/characters in 
the external application have been eliminated.&nbsp; In order to identify these 
entities their initial locations must be defined for this condition.&nbsp; An 
entity is eliminated if their health status is anything but healthy.&nbsp; The 
condition doesn't look at the cause of the change in health status so you can't, 
for example, use this condition to gaurantee that the learner was the cause of 
the change in health unless your environment/scenario guarantees that on its own 
(e.g. the learner is the only entity that will cause harm to the target entity).</p>
