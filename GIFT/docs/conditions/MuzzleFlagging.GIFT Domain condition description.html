<p><strong>Muzzle Flagging Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition checks whether the entity controlled by a player is pointing their
weapon at another entity which is being assessed by this condition. The threshold
in degrees for how closely a weapon is allowed to be pointed at an entity can be configured
within the condition. </p>
<p>Optionally, the condition can also be configured to only assess entities
who are within a certain range of one another and whether the assessed member's 
weapon safety value should be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Evaluations </strong>(Real-time)</p>
<ul>
	<li style="color: #008000">Above Expectation</li>
	<li><span style="color : #0000FF">At Expectation</span>
		<ul>
			<li>case: No assessed entities are pointing their weapons closer
			than the configured angle threshold at any other assessed entity
			within the distance optional distance threshold (if authored).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span style="color : #FF0000">Below Expectation</span>
		<ul>
			<li>case: At least one assessed entity is pointing their weapon at another
