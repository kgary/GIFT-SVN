<p><strong>PowerPoint Over Dwell Condition</strong></p>

PowerPoint slide based on timing information provided.&nbsp; The timing 
information can be provided as a single default number for all slide indexes or 
on a per slide index basis.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Evaluations </strong>(Real-time)</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #008000">Above Expectation</span></li><li>
	<span style="color : #0000FF">At Expectation</span><ul>
		<li>case: as long as the learner leaves the current slide before any 
		slide timer reaches zero</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span style="color : #FF0000">Below Expectation</span><ul>
		<li>case: when the current slide's timer reaches zero and the learner is 
		still on that slide</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Unknown<ul>
		<li>case: the default value</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Possible </em>Scored Evaluations </strong>(overall)</p>
<ul>
	<li>counts the number of timer's that reach zero when the learner is still 
	on that slide, at most this will be equal to the number of slides reached in 
	the presentation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous details</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>the condition completes when the Siman.Stop_Freeze is received which for 
	a PowerPoint show means that the show has been closed</li>
	<li>this condition can be repeated, i.e. as a slide index is reached a timer 
	is created.&nbsp; If the show has logic to jump around or repeat slides than 
	the over dwell logic can be repeated</li>
