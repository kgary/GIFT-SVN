<p><strong>Identify Points of Interest (POIs) Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition checks whether the learner has seen a set of points.&nbsp; The 
set of points is provided as input to the condition. </p>
<p>Currently to identify a point means that the underyling application must 
provide information about whether the learner can see that location.&nbsp; This 
is performed by having this condition class send a request to the Gateway module 
which than should query the application for an answer on a particular set of 
points.&nbsp; In the case of Virtual Battlespace (VBS), this is answered by 
performing Line of sight (LoS) queries in VBS.&nbsp; For performance reasons, 
this condition class will only request LoS queries once every second until all 
points have been seen.</p>
