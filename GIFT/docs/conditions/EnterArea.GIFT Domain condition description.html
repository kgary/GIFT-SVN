<p><strong>Enter Area Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition checks whether the learner has entered a location among one or 
more locations defined for this condition.&nbsp; For this condition entering a 
location is defined as reaching a location (within a defined radius) called the 
start location followed by reaching a second but different location (within a 
defined radius) called the end point.&nbsp; The learner can only be assessed 
against one of these start/end location sets at a time within this condition.&nbsp; 
This means if a learner reaches the start point for one entrance and then 
reaches the start point for a second entrance, the first entrance will no longer 
be checked against.&nbsp; This condition is useful for checking whether the 
learner has entered an area that you may or may not want them to be in (e.g. 
which doorway was entered in a building).&nbsp; It is because of either use case 
that each entrance requires the author to define the appropriate assessment 
level if that entrance is crossed by the learner.</p>
