<p><strong>Timer Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition is useful for sequencing assessments or instructional 
strategies by using the fact that this condition will result in an At 
Expectation assessment as well as be completed after the defined duration.&nbsp; 
The author can also choose to have the timer repeat until the parent concept is 
no longer in an active task.&nbsp; While configured to repeat, the condition 
will not end.</p>
