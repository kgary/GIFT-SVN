<p><strong>9 Line Report Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition is used to determine when the learner indicate that a 9 Line should be filled out.&nbsp; 
A 9 Line is an emergency medevac request.&nbsp; Currently a 9 Line learner action button 
is something that the GIFT Tutor webpage can provide if the author enables it.&nbsp; 
This learner action, along with other learner actions, can be used to provide 
another mechanism for GIFT to capture learner actions which is useful in 
situations where you are unable to incorporate certain events/tools into the 
external application but need them as part of your assessment.</p>
