<p><strong>Pace Count Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition checks whether the object/player controlled by the learner has 
moved a specified distance.&nbsp; The learner must indicate the starting and 
stoping point for this distance check by using the Start and Stop pace count 
learner actions accordingly.&nbsp; The 
condition must be configured with an ideal distance in meters.&nbsp; In addition a 
threshold in meters can be authored to provide flexibility on how exact the distance 
traveled must be to the ideal distance.&nbsp; </p>
<p>YOU MUST ASSIGN AN ENTITY TO THE LEARNER IN THIS DKF FOR THIS CONDITION TO 
WORK. [Except when using a mobile device and the mobile events course object]</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Evaluations </strong>(Real-time)</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #008000">Above Expectation</span>
	<ul>
		<li>case: the distance traveled from when the start pace count learner 
		action button was pressed until the end pace count learner action button 
		was pressed is <span class="auto-style1">within</span> the ideal 
		distance authored +/- the threshold distance.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span style="color : #0000FF">At Expectation</span><ul>
		<li>case: the distance traveled from when the start pace count learner 
		action button was pressed to the current learner location is within the 
		ideal distance authored +/- the threshold distance.&nbsp; This is useful 
		for debugging purposes as an instructional strategy (e.g. feedback) can 
		be shown to indicate that the correct distance has been reached.&nbsp; 
		This At Expectation value will be sent for every location update while 
		the learner is within the threshold distance from the ideal distance 
		traveled.</li>
