<p><strong>Follow Path Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition checks whether the learner has stays within the bounds of an 
entered path.&nbsp; This is useful for areas where you would 
like the learner to stay within a certain pre-defined cylinder.&nbsp; A path segment 
must have an entrance and exit as well as a width to the segment.&nbsp; You may 
also provide a buffer value that is used at the edge along this segment to give 
the learner leeway when it comes to assessing whether the learner is still 
within the path.</p>

		<li>case: the learner entered a path segment, has not exited that segment
		and is still within that segment's boundary</li>
		<li>case: the learner entered a path segment, has not exited that segment, 
		went outside of that segment and has now come back into that segment's 
		boundary</li>

<p><strong><em>Possible </em>Scored Evaluations </strong>(overall)</p>
<ul>
	<li>counts the total number of times the learner went outside of all 
	segment's boundaries for a path segment that the learner has entered but has 
	not properly exited </li>
	<li>provides the amount of time the learner was in violation of being 
	outside of a path segment, i.e. the total amount of time this condition was at Below Expectation. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous details</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>NEVER completes, i.e. the learner can enter/exit and be assessed on all 
	path segments any number of times</li>
	<li>can be repeated</li>
