<p><strong>Engage Targets Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition assesses whether one or more team members are properly 
engaging targets. To properly engage targets the team members specified must fire at targets that enter the member's weapon cone.</p>
<p>The author can define the targets, time to engage, field of view and weapon cone 
as inputs to the assessment algorithm.&nbsp; Only targets that are 
healthy will be considered for assessment.&nbsp; This prevents being assessed 
against objects that are dead/incapacitated.</p>
<p>The goal of this condition is to not assess every possible situation.&nbsp; 
Hopefully it provides an initial assessment result that can be used by 
observers/trainers to make additional assessments or over-rides.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Evaluations </strong>(Real-time)</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #008000">Above Expectation</span>
		<ul>
			<li>case: assessed team member(s) fired at designated target(s) 
			while that target was in the weapon cone within the time limit 
			selected for Above Expectation.&nbsp; </li>
			<li>case: the average assessment of all assessed team member(s) 
			firing at designated target(s) while that target was in the weapon 
			cone in this instance 
			averages to Above Expectation. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span style="color : #0000FF">At Expectation</span>
		<ul>
			<li>case: assessed team member(s) fired at designated target while that target was in the weapon cone 
			within the time limit selected for At Expectation.</li>
			<li>case: the average assessment of all assessed team member(s) 
			firing at designated target(s) while that target was in the weapon 
			cone in this instance 
			averages to At Expectation. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span style="color : #FF0000">Below Expectation</span>
		<ul>
			<li>case: assessed team member(s) did NOT fire at designated target 
			while target was in the weapon conde within the time limit selected 
			for At Expectation.&nbsp; Note that Below Expectation will be 
			assessed whether or not the assessed team member fires after the 
			time limit for At Expectation expires.</li>
			<li>case: the average assessment of all assessed team member(s) 
			firing at designated target(s) while the target was in the weapon 
			conde in this instance averages to Below Expectation.</li>

<p><strong><em>Possible </em>Scored Evaluations </strong>(overall)</p>
<ul>
	<li>counts the number of violations (going from At to Below Expecation)</li>
	<li>sums the duration of time in Below Expectation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous details</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>this condition does not complete</li>
	<li>&nbsp;If the assessed team member moves the weapon cone away from the 
	designated target without firing before the time limit for at expectation 
	expires, no assessment occurs.</li>
