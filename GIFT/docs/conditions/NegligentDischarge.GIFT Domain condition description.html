<p><strong>Negligent Discharge Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition assesses whether one or more team members fired their weapon 
towards an object.</p>
<p>The author can define the objects to avoid, and weapon cone 
as inputs to the assessment algorithm.&nbsp; Only targets that are 
healthy will be considered for assessment.&nbsp; This prevents being assessed 
against objects that are dead/incapacitated.</p>
<p>The goal of this condition is to not assess every possible situation.&nbsp; 
Hopefully it provides an initial assessment result that can be used by 
observers/trainers to make additional assessments or over-rides.</p>
