<p><strong>String Matching Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition is used to match a single key value pair provided to the 
condition as input.&nbsp; For example, the key maybe "opened" and the value 
might be "door A" to indicate that the learner opened door A in the application.&nbsp; 
The abstract nature of this condition allows you to easily assess events 
communicated by your application using with minimal software development in the 
GIFT domain module.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This condition is talked about in the GIFT Software Developer guide.&nbsp; It 
is also used by multiple training applications that are already integrated with 
GIFT (see Training Applications section).</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Evaluations </strong>(Real-time)</p>

	<li><span style="color: #008000">Above Expectation</span></li><li>
	<span style="color : #0000FF">At Expectation</span><ul>
		<li>case: when the key value pair in the condition matches the key value 
		pair provided</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span style="color : #FF0000">Below Expectation</span><ul>
		<li>case: when the key value pair in the condition does NOT match the

<p><strong><em>Possible </em>Scored Evaluations </strong>(overall)</p>
<ul>
	<li>counts the number of times the key value pair matches</li>
	<li>provides the amount of time it took to reach At Expectation, i.e. the 
	key value pair matched</li>
