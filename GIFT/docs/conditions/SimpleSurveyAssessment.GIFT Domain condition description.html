<p><strong>Simple Survey Assessment Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition is normally used when the author wants to apply the scoring 
results of a survey to a concept and doesn't have another condition type that 
applies to the situation.&nbsp; For example, suppose you would like to present a 
survey when the learner reaches a specific location in a virtual environment 
such as Unity.&nbsp; You don't want the survey results to change the assessment 
for reaching that location but rather for another concept such as "identifying 
land features".&nbsp; In this example you would want to use the simple survey 
assessment condition to apply the score of the survey to the "identifying land 
features" concept.</p>
