<p><strong>Fire Team Rate of Fire Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition checks whether the provided members are maintaining an 
appropriate rate of fire while this condition is being assessed. The assessment 
uses a formula called Talking the Guns (TG) which is </p>
<p>TG ratio = 1 - (total dead space time / total assessment time)</p>
<p>The total assessment time is provide by the author and is a sliding window.&nbsp; Assessments happen after the first 30 seconds and 
then every 5 seconds after that.&nbsp; Both of these values can be changed by 
the author.&nbsp; Also, the TG ratio required to achieve Below/At/Above 
expectation can be defined.</p>
