<p><strong>Application Completed Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition checks whether the currently running application (e.g. VBS, 
PowerPoint, Unity) has stopped or finished.&nbsp; The external application 
communicates this by sending on the supported simulation management message 
(SIMAN) listed below.&nbsp; Completing this condition is a useful way to 
determine when GIFT performance assessments should end.&nbsp; The condition can 
provide a single assessment based on the ideal amount of time it should take to 
finish the application.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Evaluations </strong>(Real-time)</p>
<ul>
	<li style="color: #008000">Above Expectation</li>
	<li><span style="color : #0000FF">At Expectation</span><ul>
		<li>case: a Siman.Stop_Freeze message is received and that message 
		represents a stop and not a freeze/pause.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li><span style="color : #FF0000">Below Expectation</span><ul>
		<li>case: the amount of time defined in the optional ideal completion 
		duration parameter has elapsed and the external application is still 
		running.&nbsp; This condition will not include the amount of time the 
		application was paused against this idea completion duration as long as 
		the application provided the appropriate Siman.Stop_Freeze message to 
		GIFT indicating when the pause took place.</li>

<p><strong><em>Possible </em>Scored Evaluations </strong>(overall)</p>
<ul>
	<li>counts the number of times this condition completes, i.e. the number of 
	times the condition receives the Siman.Stop_Freeze and is not a freeze/pause 
	notification.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous details</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>the condition completes when a Siman.Stop_Freeze messsage is received 
	and it is not a freeze/pause.</li>
	<li>the condition is not meant to be repeated</li>
