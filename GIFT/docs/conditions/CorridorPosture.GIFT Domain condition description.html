<p><strong>Check posture along path</strong></p>
<p>This condition checks whether the learner has stays within the bounds of an 
entered path AND while in a path segment the learner maintains 
one of the specified postures (e.g. prone, kneeling, standing...).&nbsp; This is useful for areas where you would 
like the learner to stay exposed on concealed within a certain pre-defined cylinder 
(e.g. stay low as you move along a short wall to prevent exposing yourself as a 
target or prevent reveling your movements to other characters in the 
application).&nbsp; A path segment 
must have an entrance and exit as well as a width to the segmentt.&nbsp; You may 
also provide a buffer value that is used at the edge along this segment to give 
the learner leeway when it comes to assessing whether the learner is still 
within the path.</p>

<p><strong><em>Possible </em>Scored Evaluations </strong>(overall)</p>
<ul>
	<li>counts the total number of times the learner went outside of all 
	segment's boundaries PLUS&nbsp; the number of times the learner was not in 
	the correct posture for a segment that the learner has entered but has 
	not properly exited </li>
	<li>provides the amount of time the learner was in violation of being 
	outside of a path segment PLUS the amount of time not in the correct posture 
	while inside the segment, i.e. the total amount of time this condition was at Below Expectation. </li>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous details</strong></p>

	<li>NEVER completes, i.e. the learner can enter/exit and be assessed on all
