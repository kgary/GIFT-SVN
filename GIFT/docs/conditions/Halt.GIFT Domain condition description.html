<p><strong>Halt Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition checks whether the objects/players controlled by the learner 
stop moving after the first learner stops moving.&nbsp; This condition can be 
configured with a custom assessment that will provide assessment based on how 
long it takes the learners to halt.</p>
<p>YOU MUST ASSIGN AN ENTITY TO THE LEARNER IN THIS DKF FOR THIS CONDITION TO 
WORK.</p>
