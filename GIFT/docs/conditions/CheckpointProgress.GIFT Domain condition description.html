<p><strong>Checkpoint Progress Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition checks the pace of the learner's player/character/entity in 
the external application through one or more, ordered, checkpoints.&nbsp; The 
condition requires one or more checkpoints to be provided, each defined by a 
location (e.g. GDC) with a time 
constraint.&nbsp; Each time constraint can also have a window of opportunity 
associated with it to act as a grace period for the learner to reach that 
checkpoint and not be negatively assessed.</p>
<p>This is different than Checkpoint Pace condition because in this 
condition a timer is created for each checkpoint using the elapsed scenario time 
defined in the checkpoint's time constraint.&nbsp; If a checkpoint's timer 
reaches zero and the learner has not arrived at that checkpoint's location, the 
learner will be negatively assessed. </p>
<p><strong>Assessment Evaluations </strong>(Real-time)</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #008000">Above Expectation</span><ul>
		<li>case: the learner reached the next checkpoint in the list ahead of 
		schedule</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<span style="color : #0000FF">At Expectation</span><ul>
		<li>case: reached the next checkpoint in the list within the time 
		constraint grace period (window)</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span style="color : #FF0000">Below Expectation</span><ul>
		<li>case: a checkpoint's timer reached zero and the learner has not 
		arrived at that checpoint's location</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><em>Possible </em>Scored Evaluations </strong>(overall)</p>
<ul>
	<li>counts the number of checkpoints that were not reached on time</li>
	<li>provides the amount of time the learner was in violation of being behind 
	progress, i.e. the total amount of time this condition was at Below Expectation. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous details</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>completes after the last checkpoint location has been reached and 
	assessed</li>
	<li>can not be repeated, i.e. once you reach the last checkpoint you can't 
	start this same condition instance from the first checkpoint</li>
</ul>
