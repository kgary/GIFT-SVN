<p><strong>Has Moved Excavator Component Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition checks whether the learner has moved a specific Excavator 
component (e.g. boom, bucket) enough to warrant an assessment.&nbsp; The author 
must provide one or more components that could be moved for this assessment.&nbsp; 
For each component the type of direction allowed {any direction, bidirectional} 
is optional (the default being bidirectional).</p>
<p>The expected movements for each component are as follows:</p>
<p>Swing - 90 degrees, Boom - 90 degrees, Arm - 180 degrees, Bucket, 180 degrees</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Evaluations </strong>(Real-time)</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #008000">Above Expectation</span></li><ul>
		<li>case: the correct component is moved the desired distance as defined 
		by the author</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span style="color : #0000FF">At Expectation</span><li>
	<span style="color : #FF0000">Below Expectation</span><ul>
		<li>case: the default value</li>
		<li>case: the wrong component is moved, i.e. another component besides 
		the one this condition has been configured to assess is being moved</li>

<p><strong><em>Possible </em>Scored Evaluations </strong>(overall)</p>
<ul>
	<li>counts the number of times the movement assessment is assessed 
	(positvely or negatively, right or wrong)</li>
	<li>provides the amount of time it took the condition to complete, i.e. the 
	learner has completed all assessments by moving the specified component</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous details</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>the condition completes once the excavator component movement is 
	assessed the maximum number of assessment times as defined by the author</li>
	<li>the condition can't be repeated</li>
