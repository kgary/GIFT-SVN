<p><strong>Detect Objects Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition assesses whether one or more team members are properly 
detecting objects within a window of time after the object has entered the field 
of view. </p>
<p>Currently, to detect an object means to orient to that object within a 
specified cone in degrees after that object has entered the larger field of view.&nbsp; In the future other means of 'detection' might 
be supported such as pressing a button, verbal communication or other action 
naitve to the training environment.</p>
<p>The author can define the objects, time to detect, field of view, and orient 
cone 
as inputs to the assessment algorithm.&nbsp; Only objects that are 
healthy will be considered for assessment.&nbsp; This prevents being assessed 
against objects that are dead/incapacitated.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The goal of this condition is to not assess every possible situation.&nbsp; 
Hopefully it provides an initial assessment result that can be used by 
observers/trainers to make additional assessments or over-rides.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Evaluations </strong>(Real-time)</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #008000">Above Expectation</span>
		<ul>
			<li>case: assessed team member(s) have detected objects within the 
			time specificed to receive an Above Expectation.&nbsp; </li>
			<li>case: the average assessment of all detections in this instance 
			averages to Above Expectation. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span style="color : #0000FF">At Expectation</span>
		<ul>
			<li>case: assessed team member(s) have detected objects within the 
			time specified to receive an At Expectation.&nbsp; </li>
			<li>case: the average assessment of all detections in this instance 
			averages to At Expectation.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span style="color : #FF0000">Below Expectation</span>
		<ul>
			<li>case: assessed team member(s) have detected objects beyond the 
			time specified to receive an At or Above Expectation.&nbsp; This 
			includes not detecting objects that come within the field of view.</li>
			<li>case the average assessment of all detections in this instance 
			averages to Below Expectation.</li>

			<li>case: The default initial value of this condition. </li>
	</ul>
		</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Possible </em>Scored Evaluations </strong>(overall)</p>
<ul>
	<li>counts the number of violations (going from At/Above to Below Expecation)</li>
	<li>sums the duration of time in Below Expectation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous details</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>this condition DOES complete when all objects have been assessed (i.e. 
	found within the field of view and either detected or not detected)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Intended</em> Training Applications and Domains</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>any application that can produce entity state</li>
