<p><strong>Use Radio Condition</strong></p>
<p>This condition is used to determine when the learner indicates that the radio should be 
used.&nbsp; Currently the GIFT learner action radio button 
is something that the GIFT Tutor webpage can provide if the author enables it.&nbsp; 
This learner action, along with other learner actions, can be used to provide 
another mechanism for GIFT to capture learner actions which is useful in 
situations where you are unable to incorporate certain events/tools into the 
external application but need them as part of your assessment.</p>
