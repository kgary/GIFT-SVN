            Deleting a course will also delete any files associated with it, which could potentially invalidate any
            courses that reference such files or cause problems during course execution.

           	<b><i>If there has been any published courses created (from the Publish Courses Panel) and any data collected 
           	for a course being deleted, the published course will not be deleted, but users will no longer 
           	be able to take the course associated with the published courses.</i></b>

            If you wish to delete a course without causing problems, you should make sure that no other 
            files reference the files inside of it. 
            The course(s) should not be open in the Course Creator when deleting, otherwise the course will be recreated when saved.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Are you sure you still want to delete these course(s)?
