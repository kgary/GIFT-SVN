The tincan-1.1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar was provided by Will Hoyt (Yet Analytics) as a replacement for the previous tincan with dependencies jar GIFT was using.  I believe
Will successfully built the TinCan source available on github which then produces this jar.  Then the two jackson jar's where added by using the Maven URLs
provided in that TinCan github project.
