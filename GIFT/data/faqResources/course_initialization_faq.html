    <h2 id="why_am_I_seeing_the_comm_app_download_page">Why am I seeing the Gateway
      Module setup page?</h2>
    <p>The course you are currently running will require interaction with a
      training application (e.g. PowerPoint, VBS, DE Testbed) at some
      point.&nbsp; These training applications cannot be run in your browser and
      instead must run using installed software on your computer.&nbsp;
      Therefore in order to continue this course you must download and install
      the Gateway Module.&nbsp; </p>
    <h2 id="why_do_I_need_to_download_the_communication_module">Why do I need to
      download the Gateway Module?</h2>
    <p>The Gateway Module is needed in order for GIFT to be able to communicate
      with and sometimes control the training applications on your computer
      needed for this course. Due to web security restrictions, you will need to
      first download this application, then run it.&nbsp; In some instances you
      maybe asked for configuration information for these training applications
      before the Gateway Module can begin communicating with GIFT.&nbsp; Once
      configured, you will be allowed to continue the course.</p>
    <h2 id="why_is_there_a_notification_that_the_file_may_harm_my_computer">Why
      is there a notification that the file may harm my computer?</h2>
    <p>Whether or not you see a notification about the GIFT Gateway Module file
      (.zip) depends on the security settings of your browser.&nbsp; By default 
	  you should see at least one prompt notifying you that the file could be harmful
	  -<em> if you don't trust the creator</em>.&nbsp; If you want to execute the GIFT 
	  course you will have to accept the risk.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="i_get_a_message_windows_firewall_has_blocked">I get a message
      "Windows Firewall has blocked some features of this program".&nbsp; What
      do I do?</h2>
    <p>Depending on your security settings, you may get a Windows prompt stating
      "Windows Firewall has blocked some features of this program" when running
      the GIFT Gateway Module.&nbsp; If you want to run the GIFT course, you
      will need to select "Allow access" when running the GIFT Gateway
      Module.&nbsp;&nbsp; The GIFT Gateway Module communicates with the GIFT
      server and external training applications (such as PowerPoint, VBS, DE
      Testbed) and needs to be allowed access to the network.&nbsp; </p>
    <h2 id="im_unable_to_open_the_communication_application">I'm unable to open
      the Gateway Module once it downloads.&nbsp;&nbsp; What do I do?</h2>
    <p>After the Gateway Module downloads, you need to open it
      manually.&nbsp; If you're having trouble opening the Gateway Module,
      please make sure that the *zip file has been extracted, you have navigated to 
	  within the extracted folder, and you have run startGIFTGateway.bat</p>
    <h2 id="where_does_the_communication_app_get_saved_when_it_is_downloaded">Where
      does the Gateway Module get saved when it is downloaded?</h2>
    <p>The Gateway Module file (.zip) will be saved to the downloads folder for
      your browser.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <h2 id="why_cant_I_run_a_previous_version">Why can't I run a previously
      downloaded version of the Gateway Module?</h2>
    <p>In order to guarantee the latest experience with the GIFT version you are
      interacting with you will need to use the version provided at the point
      when executing the course.&nbsp; If you don't, not only could you
      experience a legacy interaction but the Gateway Module or course might not
      work at all.&nbsp; To see the GIFT version information associated with the
      Gateway Module, use the system tray icon to view the "About" dialog.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2 id="what_do_I_do">I've downloaded the Gateway Module and accepted the
      security risk, but nothing is happening. What do I do?</h2>
    <p>If nothing is happening, then something might have gone wrong with the
      Gateway module's installation process. To contact support, create a forum
      post at the <a href="https://gifttutoring.org/projects/gift/boards/5">GIFT
        Troubleshooting Forum</a> describing your issue and what steps led you
      to it.</p>
    <h2 id="exception_port_1001">I see the following exception when running the Gateway Module: 
      "Caught exception while trying to establish connection to ActiveMQ.  Is ActiveMQ running 
      at tcp://gifttutoring.org:1001?"  How can I resolve this?</h2>
    <p>If you see an exception that reads "Caught exception while trying to establish connection to ActiveMQ.  
      Is ActiveMQ running at tcp://gifttutoring.org:1001?" when running the Gateway Module, please make sure 
      that your network has tcp port 1001 open for both inbound and outbound traffic.  
      The Gateway Module communicates via tcp port 1001 for sending and receiving messages to/from the GIFT 
      server.  If that port is not open, then that exception will be generated.</p>
