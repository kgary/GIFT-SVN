This is a GIFT export of a Tutor created using the GIFT export tool.  It contains one or more
exported courses (listed at the bottom of this README) and a fully configured GIFT instance.

Quick Start

To install this version of GIFT, execute the "installGIFT.bat" file located adjacent to this README.

Once the installation is complete you will notice a new file appear alongside the install file called "launchGIFT.bat".
Double left click on that file to launch the newly installed GIFT.

You will notice a GIFT system icon tray appear on your computer.  A short time later an Internet
Explorer window will appear with the GIFT Tutor login screen.

Creating a new user

This exported version of GIFT comes equipped with a clean
embedded database. Since it is clean you will need to create
a user before starting a lesson. 

There are two ways to create a new user:
1) If you have a GIFT account (on gifttutoring.org) and your GIFT machine has
access to the internet, you can use those credentials to login to this GIFT instance.
2) otherwise, you can click on the 'go to simple login' link to open the GIFT simple login page. 
To create a new user on this webpage, click on the Create New User button.

System tray icon

When running GIFT in Learner mode (instead of Power User mode) a GIFT system tray
icon will be available to interact with the GIFT system.
Currently, this icon can be used to re open the GIFT webpage
if it is closed, or exit the system.

Warning

The folder structure in a GIFT export mimics that of a development version of GIFT.  Furthermore,
the documents provided in the GIFT export refer to that standard GIFT configuration.

Powerpoint

Many GIFT lessons use PowerPoint as a learning tool. Before
launching GIFT make sure any important PowerPoint work is saved
and PowerPoint is closed to reduce the risk of data loss.
