This folder contains the schema (.xsd) files for all GIFT XML file types authored by GIFT authoring tools. 
The files cover all versions of GIFT since GIFT v2.0. In addition there are fully populated (i.e. every XML 
element is used) versions of Course and DKF XML files for each GIFT version. These files are useful for 
testing the GIFT XML file conversion logic.
