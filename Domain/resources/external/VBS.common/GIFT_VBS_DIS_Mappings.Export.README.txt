The file GIFT_VBS_DIS_Mappings.Export.csv was created on 10.11.17 and is an export of the DIS mappings in VBS3 v3.9.2.

For VBS v3.9.2, this csv file should be imported into VBS via the import mappings option on http://localhost:2310/ui/VBSGateway.

For VBS 19.1.6, this csv file should be imported into VBS via the import mappings option on http://localhost:9003/index.html#/.

NOTE: An issue has been found where VBS 19.1.6 occasionally does not import GIFT_VBS_DIS_Mappings.Export.csv properly. If this issue
occurs, then exporting VBS's current mappings to a csv file after performing the import will create a file that is smaller than 
GIFT_VBS_DIS_Mappings.Export.csv. To fix this, copy GIFT_VBS_DIS_Mappings.Export.csv to the components/Gateway folder inside your
VBS installaton, import the copied GIFT_VBS_DIS_Mappings.Export.csv file from that location, and then restart VBS after the import 
completes. If the csv file was imported correctly, then exporting the mappings to a csv file should create a file that is larger than
GIFT_VBS_DIS_Mappings.Export.csv.

GIFT_VBS_DIS_Mappings.Export.csv was created by performing the following:
1. installing VBS3 v3.9.2
2. starting VBS using the GIFT VBS shortcut (including -gateway -admin args)
3. loaded the GIFT VBS presence patrol scenario into VBS as a network scenario
4. opened http://localhost:2310/ui/VBSGateway
5. filled in the missing DIS mappings
6. exported the mappings to a .csv file via the export mappings option on http://localhost:2310/ui/VBSGateway
7. manually added the DIS mappings to this .csv file that were added by the GIFT Development team for the GIFT VBS Clear Building scenario.
