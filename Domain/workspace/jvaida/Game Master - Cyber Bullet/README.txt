In order to run the VBS portion of this GIFT course you will need several VBS files:

1. scenario - a folder called "Storyboard_GPS_Cyber13_NoDie.map_samawah50km_ieed" and a file called Storyboard_GPS_Cyber13_NoDie.map_samawah50km_ieed.pbo
2. models and terrains - 32 folders that need to be placed in <vbs install>\content\

These files need to be placed in the appropriate directories before starting the GIFT course.

A zip has been created that contains all of these files and instructions ("CyberBullet_dependancy files.zip").

Zip location [for Dignitas employees ONLY]:
X:\Projects\LITE-GIFT\Development Efforts\VBS\VBS Scenarios\Game Master - Cyber Bullet\CyberBullet_dependancy files.zip
